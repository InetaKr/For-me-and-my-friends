      "genre": "Thriller",
      "description": "The story of Jeffrey Dahmer, one of America's most notorious serial killers, partly told from the point of view of his victims. The series dives into the police incompetence and apathy that allowed the Wisconsin native to go on a multiyear killing spree. It dramatizes multiple instances where Dahmer was almost apprehended, but ultimately let go. Dahmer was a cleancut guy, who was repeatedly given a free pass by cops, as well as by judges, who were lenient when he had been charged with crimes.",
